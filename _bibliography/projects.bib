  title={The Effect Of Data Augmentation on Deep Representations},
  author={Phuc Ngo, Dimitris Tsipras, Saachi Jain and Aleksander Mądry},
  abstract={Data augmentation is a simple and common technique that increases the model’s robustness to class-preserving transformations. However, our understanding of how data augmentation affects deep representations is limited. In this work, we attempt to study this further and hypothesize two mechanisms that could happen. The earlier layers of the model could map augmented inputs to similar representations to the standard inputs counterpart. Or, the model could use an entirely different set of prediction rules to classify augmented samples. To test the hypothesis, we trained standard and augmented models to analyze the similarity between their predictions and representations. Our results suggest data augmentation has a range of behavior on deep representations. Depending on the severity of the augmentation, models can vary between learning invariance or learning entirely separate augmented subpopulations.},
