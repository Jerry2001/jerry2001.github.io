  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={A Study on Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms Using the Leaf Dataset},
  author={P. H. Ngo and D. Kwon},
  journal={Journal of Industrial Information Technology and Application,},
  abstract={Machine learning is widely used for classification in various fields. In this
research, we compared and analyzed the performance of three popular machine learning
classifiers such as KNN, SVM, and ANN, using the leaf dataset. The original dataset
was preprocessed, and the feature selection technique was used to divide the
preprocessed dataset into two different types of the dataset. According to experiments,
the ANN classifier showed 76.18% of accuracy when all the features were employed,
and it outperformed other classifiers. However, when partial features were employed,
the SVM classifier showed 73.31% of accuracy that outperformed other classifiers.},
