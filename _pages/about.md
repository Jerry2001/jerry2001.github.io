I am a junior at Beloit College pursuing double majors in Computer Science and Math. Fortunately, most of my research projects were advised by [<u>Mehmet Dik</u>](https://www.rockford.edu/campus-directory/dik-mehmet/){:target="\_blank"} and [<u>Donghoon Kwon</u>](https://www.rockford.edu/campus-directory/kwon-donghwoon/){:target="\_blank"}. 

In the past, I had the opportunity to work at [<u>MIT CSAIL</u>](https://www.csail.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under the [<u>Mądry Lab</u>](http://madry-lab.ml/){:target="\_blank"} of [<u>Aleksander Mądry</u>](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/){:target="\_blank"}.

I am currently interested in generative models and representation learning.
