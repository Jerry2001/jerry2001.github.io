I am a research technician at [McGovern Institute](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"} and <a href="https://bcs.mit.edu/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#02516f">MIT</span> <span style="color:#01789b">BC</span>S</a>, supervised by [Jim DiCarlo](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/james-dicarlo/){:target="\_blank"}. My current research interests are computer vision, neuroAI, multimodality learning, and generative models.

Before joining BCS, I have been working at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT <span style="color:#c44404">CS</span><span style="color:#C4800A">AI</span>L</a> for some time. At CSAIL, I am fortunate to be supervised by [Phillip Isola](http://web.mit.edu/phillipi/){:target="\_blank"} and [Aleksander MÄ…dry](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/){:target="\_blank"} and to be able to collaborate with [Yoon Kim](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yoonkim/){:target="\_blank"}.

I obtained my bachelor's degree at [Beloit College](https://www.beloit.edu/){:target="\_blank"} in Computer Science and Math.
