I am a junior at Beloit College pursuing double majors in Computer Science and Math. Fortunately, I was advised by [Ranjan Roy](https://www.beloit.edu/live/profiles/275-ranjan-roy){:target="\_blank"} and [Darrah Chavey](https://www.beloit.edu/live/profiles/272-darrah-chavey){:target="\_blank"}. My current interests are generative models and representation learning. I am working with [Phillip Isola](http://web.mit.edu/phillipi/){:target="\_blank"} from MIT. 

In the past, I had the opportunity to work at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under the [Mądry Lab](http://madry-lab.ml/){:target="\_blank"} of [Aleksander Mądry](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/){:target="\_blank"}.
