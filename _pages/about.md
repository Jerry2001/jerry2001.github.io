I am a junior at Beloit College pursuing double majors in Computer Science and Math. Fortunately, most of my research projects were advised by [Mehmet Dik](https://www.rockford.edu/campus-directory/dik-mehmet/){:target="\_blank"} and [Donghoon Kwon](https://www.rockford.edu/campus-directory/kwon-donghwoon/){:target="\_blank"}. 

In the past, I had the opportunity to work at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under the [Mądry Lab](http://madry-lab.ml/){:target="\_blank"} of [Aleksander Mądry](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/){:target="\_blank"}.

I am currently interested in generative models and representation learning.
