I am a research technician at [McGovern Institute](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"} and [MIT BCS](https://bcs.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, supervised by [Jim DiCarlo](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/james-dicarlo/){:target="\_blank"}. My current research interests are computer vision, neuroAI, multimodality learning, and generative models.

Before joining BCS, I have been working at MIT CSAIL for some time. At CSAIL, I am fortunate to be supervised by [Phillip Isola](http://web.mit.edu/phillipi/){:target="\_blank"} and [Aleksander MÄ…dry](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/){:target="\_blank"} and to be able to collaborate with [Yoon Kim](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yoonkim/){:target="\_blank"}.

I obtained my bachelor's degree at Beloit College in Computer Science and Math.
