I am a senior at Beloit College pursuing double majors in Computer Science and Math. 

Currently, I am working on generative models and computer vision with [Phillip Isola](http://web.mit.edu/phillipi/){:target="\_blank"} and [Swami Sankaranarayanan](https://swamiviv.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} from [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. Previously, I was an MIT CSAIL research intern working with [Aleksander Mądry](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/){:target="\_blank"} at [Mądry Lab](http://madry-lab.ml/){:target="\_blank"}.

My current research interests are deep learning, computer vision, multimodality learning, and generative models.
