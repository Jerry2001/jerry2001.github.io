I am a research associate at [McGovern Institute](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"} and <a class="gray-url" href="https://bcs.mit.edu/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#02516f"></span><span style="color:#01789b">MIT BC</span>S</a>, supervised by [Jim DiCarlo](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/james-dicarlo/){:target="\_blank"}. During my undergraduate, my research journey took root at <a class="gray-url" href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT <span style="color:#c44404">CS</span><span style="color:#C4800A">AI</span>L</a>, where I still involve as a frequent collaborator. At CSAIL, I was fortunate to be supervised by [Phillip Isola](http://web.mit.edu/phillipi/){:target="\_blank"}, [Yoon Kim](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yoonkim/){:target="\_blank"}, and [Aleksander MÄ…dry](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/){:target="\_blank"}.

With a broad research goal of understanding AI, I ground my works at the intersection of computer vision and neuro/cognitive science. Currently, my projects are focused on quantifying behavioral similarities and disparities between vision models and human behavior ([1](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YdGkE4Ugg2C){:target="\_blank"}, [2](http://brain-score.org/){:target="\_blank"}). I am also interested in other topics like multimodality/representation learning, and generative modeling.
